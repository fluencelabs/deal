Usage: [BASIC_AUTH_SUBGRAPH] ${script_name} network action
Deploy subgraph to Fluence stands, or local. Store deployment artifacts (local is ignored).

  network       Fluence network to run against - local, stage, dar or kras
  action        action to run - create, deploy or delete

Examples:
  BASIC_AUTH_SUBGRAPH=user:pass ${script_name} stage deploy     Deploy subgraph to stage
  ${script_name} local deploy                                   Deploy subgraph to local (BASIC_AUTH_SUBGRAPH not used)

Envs:
  - GRAPHNODE_ADMIN_URL_LOCAL: url for local network admin graph panel.
  - GRAPHNODE_QUERY_URL_LOCAL: url for local network graph query
  - SUBGRAPH_NAME_TO_DELETE: e.g. for local fluence-deal-contracts
